# 📌 Sidebar Chatbot (FAQ)
st.sidebar.subheader("💬 Ask the Chatbot")

# 🔹 Complete FAQ List
faq_data = {
    # General Questions
    "What does this app do?": "This app converts a series of molecule images into a smooth video or GIF.",
    "Who can use this app?": "Anyone! Researchers, students, and professionals working with molecule animations.",
    "Is this app free to use?": "Yes! It is completely free to use.",
    "Can I use this app on mobile devices?": "Yes, but for better experience, use it on a desktop or tablet.",

    # File Upload Questions
    "What file types are supported for uploading?": "PNG, JPG, and JPEG formats are supported.",
    "How many images can I upload at once?": "There is no strict limit, but too many images may slow down processing.",
    "Can I upload images in any order?": "The app sorts images alphabetically, so rename them (1.png, 2.png, etc.).",
    
    # Video & GIF Creation Questions
    "How does this app convert images into a video?": "It stitches your images together using MoviePy.",
    "How long does it take to create a video?": "Processing time depends on the number of images and FPS settings.",
    "What FPS should I choose?": "12-24 FPS is ideal for smooth animations.",
    "What is the difference between a video and a GIF?": "Videos are MP4 format with better quality, while GIFs are more compressed.",
    "Can I create both a video and a GIF at the same time?": "Yes, the app generates both simultaneously.",

    # Download & Storage Questions
    "How do I download my video or GIF?": "Click the download button after processing is complete.",
    "Where is my downloaded file saved?": "It is saved in your default 'Downloads' folder.",
    "Will my uploaded images be stored on the server?": "No, uploaded images are processed temporarily and not stored.",

    # Troubleshooting Questions
    "Why is my video not generating?": "Check if you uploaded images and selected FPS properly.",
    "Why does my video appear blurry?": "Use high-quality images for the best results.",
    "Why is the animation too fast or too slow?": "Adjust the FPS settings in the sidebar.",
}
